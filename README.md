---> Hi My name is Abdi Adem. I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of data science. 
With a degree in Industrial Engineering and an interest in analytics, it is only natural that I have a desire to get into data science, 
as there is quite an overlap between engineering and data science with the use of analysis and problem solving.
I am currently learning Python and other related skills needed to become a data analyst.

You can reach me by email at abdi-adem@hotmail.com
