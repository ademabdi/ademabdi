  ## Introduction
  
  Hi My name is Abdi Adem. I am an AWS re/Start and Industrial Engineering graduate, and some of my interests are in cloud computing, cybersecurity, programming, web design, blockchain technology, and data science. My projects currently are more on the data science side, but I am interested in pursuing projects related to my other interests (i.e. portfolio website, cloud deployment, keylogger).  
  
  ## Currently working on:
  
   I am currently working on learning web development, alongside developing my knowledge of AWS. I am currently attending a cloud bootcamp where we work on integrating AWS services into a microblogging platform. So far, the experience has been great as I have been exposed to how it might be like to work on a project with a higher level of complexity, much like working for a company. The platform backend is written in Flask (Python framework), and the frontend framework is React, with the standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript wombo combo. Some of the tools used so far are Docker for containerization, Amazon Cognito and Amplify for authentication, Billing console for managing spend, as well as tools for distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray, Rollbar, Honeycomb).
