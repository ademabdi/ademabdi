  Hi My name is Abdi Adem. I am an Industrial Engineering graduate, and some of my interests are in cloud computing, cybersecurity, programming, web design, blockchain technology, and data science. My projects currently are more on the data science side, but I am currently interested in pursuing projects related to my other interests (i.e. portfolio website, cloud deployment, keylogger).
